      <p>The Big Brick House Project applies web design tools to move a hard copy book created by the grandchildren of Joe and Ethel Moonan to digital and extensible version that could easily be updated and enhanced with more stories, images, and a wealth of relevant linked data and resources.</p>
<p>In 1914, when the house built by John Moonan was being sold outside of the Moonan family for only the second time, the grandchildren, many of whom had reached the time of life when one reflects back on childhood, exchanged a flurry of stories, photos, and questions on a shared e-mail group. Discovering that this house was truly the “sense of place” for many of the cousins, they decided to create a “My Publisher” book for the new house family. The resulting book was filled with stories, recollections, images, architectural plans, and more, and yet it called for a customizable interface that would allow us to continue to collect and share more.
